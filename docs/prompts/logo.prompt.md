Let's add very modern and sophisticated logo to the project in form of SVG file. It should show outline of the human brain, it should have that overall shape, from the side. The brain shape should be composed of triangulated network of connections, between vertices, that basically build out the brain shape. There should be brain/spine stem at the bottom of it as well. Shape is stylized, approximate brain, but resembles it's overall shape.

It should be transparent except very small vertices (very slightly larger than connection thickness, maybe 25% at most, radius of vertice larger than tickness of a connection). Thickness of the connections should be something like 1mm. 

There should be overall gradient color over the brain shape, by coloring adjecent connections in slightly offset shades of colors. Overall gradient should be spanning from greenish-blue to purple, and it should be strong, brigh colors, with slight outer glow if possible.

Background of the entire shape should be very, very darg gray, 5% lighter than black at most. 

Shape should be rendered in space of 512 by 512 px at most in the base README.md 

Create assets folder, then logo inside of it and place logo.svg in it.

Create very pretty designed SVG logo as described and include it in the README.md at hte base of the project.
