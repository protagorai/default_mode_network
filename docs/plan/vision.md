# Vision Document: Synthetic Default Mode Network Framework

## Executive Summary

The Synthetic Default Mode Network (SDMN) Framework represents a paradigm shift in neural network simulation, focusing on biologically-inspired spiking neural networks that can generate synthetic brain-wave patterns analogous to human EEG recordings. This framework will serve as a research platform for understanding and eventually surpassing the complexity of human neural networks.

## Research Vision

### Core Objectives

1. **Biological Fidelity**: Create artificial spiking neural networks that closely mimic the behavior of biological neurons, including membrane dynamics, action potential generation, and synaptic transmission.

2. **Default Mode Network Simulation**: Focus specifically on modeling default mode networks (DMNs) - the brain regions active during rest and introspection - to understand consciousness, self-referential thinking, and spontaneous cognition.

3. **Synthetic Brain Waves**: Generate artificial neural oscillations that replicate the patterns observed in human EEG recordings, including alpha, beta, gamma, theta, and delta waves.

4. **Emergent Complexity**: Study how simple spiking neuron interactions can give rise to complex, higher-order behaviors and cognitive-like processes.

5. **Scalable Architecture**: Design a framework that can scale from small networks (hundreds of neurons) to massive networks (millions or billions of neurons) that approach biological complexity.
