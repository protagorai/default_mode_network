# Vision Document: Synthetic Default Mode Network Framework

## Executive Summary

The Synthetic Default Mode Network (SDMN) Framework represents a paradigm shift in neural network simulation, focusing on biologically-inspired spiking neural networks that can generate synthetic brain-wave patterns analogous to human EEG recordings. This framework will serve as a research platform for understanding and eventually surpassing the complexity of human neural networks.

## Research Vision

### Core Objectives

1. **Biological Fidelity**: Create artificial spiking neural networks that closely mimic the behavior of biological neurons, including membrane dynamics, action potential generation, and synaptic transmission.

2. **Default Mode Network Simulation**: Focus specifically on modeling default mode networks (DMNs) - the brain regions active during rest and introspection - to understand consciousness, self-referential thinking, and spontaneous cognition. Based on neuroscience research from the [Default Mode Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network), these networks are primarily composed of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and angular gyrus.

3. **Synthetic Brain Waves**: Generate artificial neural oscillations that replicate the patterns observed in human EEG recordings, including alpha, beta, gamma, theta, and delta waves that correlate with different cognitive states and self-awareness levels.

4. **Emergent Self-Awareness**: Study how feedback loops between artificial DMN regions can give rise to basic self-awareness, including self-monitoring, self-referential processing, and the creation of an internal narrative or sense of self.

5. **Self-Preservation Intelligence**: Develop artificial systems that demonstrate fundamental self-preservation behaviors through risk-reward assessment, threat recognition, and adaptive decision-making based on projected outcomes.

6. **Emergent Complexity**: Study how simple spiking neuron interactions can give rise to complex, higher-order behaviors and cognitive-like processes, particularly those related to self-awareness and survival optimization.

7. **Scalable Architecture**: Design a framework that can scale from small networks (hundreds of neurons) to massive networks (millions or billions of neurons) that approach biological complexity while maintaining self-awareness capabilities.
