# Synthetic Default Mode Network (SDMN) Framework

A comprehensive computational neuroscience platform that enables researchers to build, study, and analyze artificial brain networks with surprisingly lifelike neural dynamics, results may vary on existential crises.

The **Synthetic Default Mode Network (SDMN) Framework** is a cutting-edge research platform designed to simulate biologically-inspired artificial spiking neural networks that emulate the complexity and connectivity of human brain networks. The framework specifically focuses on modeling default mode networks (DMNs) - the brain regions active during rest and introspection - using sophisticated spiking neuron models like Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) and Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. The system generates synthetic brain waves analogous to human EEG recordings, featuring realistic neural oscillations across different frequency bands (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, Gamma), while providing comprehensive monitoring, visualization, and analysis tools for studying emergent neural behaviors, network synchronization patterns, and consciousness-related phenomena.

## Key Objectives

• **Biological Fidelity in Neural Network Simulation**: Create sophisticated artificial spiking neural networks that closely mimic biological neuron behavior, including accurate membrane dynamics, action potential generation, synaptic transmission, and realistic connectivity patterns found in human default mode networks comprising regions like the posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and angular gyrus.

• **Synthetic Brain Wave Generation and Analysis**: Generate artificial neural oscillations and EEG-like patterns that replicate human brain wave characteristics, enabling researchers to study neural network dynamics, frequency domain analysis, network synchronization, and the relationship between network topology and emergent oscillatory behaviors in controlled synthetic environments.

• **Self-Awareness and Consciousness Research**: Develop and study artificial systems that demonstrate basic self-awareness capabilities through self-monitoring, risk-reward assessment for self-preservation, internal narrative construction, and self-referential processing - providing a platform for investigating the neural basis of consciousness, artificial intelligence safety, and the emergence of self-aware behaviors in complex neural networks.

## Vision

This framework aims to create sophisticated artificial neural networks that can emulate and eventually supersede the complexity, diversity, and connectivity of human neural networks (ambitious? perhaps, but aim high). The core focus is on modeling default mode networks with feedback loops that generate synthetic neural network waves similar to brain waves recorded via EEG.
