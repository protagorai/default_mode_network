# Synthetic Default Mode Network (SDMN) Framework

A cutting-edge research framework for simulating synthetic default mode networks using artificial spiking neural networks inspired by biological neurons.

## Vision

This framework aims to create sophisticated artificial neural networks that can emulate and eventually supersede the complexity, diversity, and connectivity of human neural networks. The core focus is on modeling default mode networks with feedback loops that generate synthetic neural network waves similar to brain waves recorded via EEG.

## Key Features

- **Spiking Neural Network Simulation**: Biologically-inspired artificial spiking neurons
- **Modular Design**: Standardized interfaces for interchangeable neuron models
- **Simulation Engine**: High-performance core engine for neural network simulation
- **Probe System**: Real-time monitoring and data collection at any network point
- **Network Assembly Tools**: GUI and programmatic tools for building complex networks
- **Visualization Suite**: Comprehensive tools for network analysis and behavior visualization
- **Feedback Loop Analysis**: Study emergent patterns and higher-order network modes
