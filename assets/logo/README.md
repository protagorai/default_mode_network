# SDMN Framework Logo Assets

This directory contains the official logo assets for the Synthetic Default Mode Network (SDMN) Framework.

## Versions

- **v1**: Initial logo set with triangulated network brain profile (archived)
- **v2**: Improved regionalized and gyri-inspired triangulations (archived)  
- **v3**: Systematic orthogonal mesh with proper brain anatomy and structured triangulation (current)

## Logo Variants

### `logo.svg` - Main Logo
- **Size**: 512×512px
- **Use**: Primary logo for documentation, presentations, headers
- **Features**: Full triangulated brain network with detailed connections
- **Colors**: Greenish-blue to purple gradient with outer glow
- **Background**: Very dark gray (#0D0D0D)

### `logo_small.svg` - Small Logo  
- **Size**: 128×128px (viewBox: 512×512)
- **Use**: Documentation thumbnails, smaller displays
- **Features**: Simplified network connections for clarity at small sizes
- **Colors**: Same gradient scheme as main logo
- **Background**: Very dark gray (#0D0D0D)

### `logo_icon.svg` - Icon Version
- **Size**: 64×64px (viewBox: 512×512) 
- **Use**: Favicons, app icons, very small contexts
- **Features**: Minimal brain outline with key network nodes
- **Colors**: Simplified gradient for maximum impact
- **Background**: Very dark gray with rounded corners

## Design Principles

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Gradient**: Greenish-blue (#00E5CC) → Purple (#9932CC)
- **Secondary Colors**: Blue (#1E90FF) → Violet (#8A2BE2)  
- **Accent**: Cyan (#00CED1) → Magenta (#8B008B)
- **Background**: Very dark gray (#0D0D0D - 5% lighter than black)

### Visual Elements
- **Brain Shape**: Side profile view of human brain with brain stem
- **Network Structure**: Triangulated connections forming the brain outline
- **Vertices**: Small nodes (25% larger than connection thickness)
- **Connections**: 2px stroke weight with varying opacity for depth
- **Effects**: Outer glow for synthetic/digital aesthetic

### Symbolism
- **Triangulated Network**: Represents the computational/digital nature
- **Brain Profile**: Biological inspiration and neuroscience focus
- **Gradient Colors**: Technology meets biology (blue-green to purple)  
- **Network Topology**: Default mode network connectivity patterns
- **Glowing Effect**: Synthetic/artificial neural activity

## Usage Guidelines

## V3 Improvements (Current)

### Key Features
- **Systematic Approach**: High-resolution orthogonal mesh with algorithmic point selection
- **Anatomical Accuracy**: Realistic brain silhouette from lateral view
- **Structured Network**: Grid-based triangulation following brain topology
- **Neon Gradient**: Turquoise → Blue → Purple with subtle glow effect
- **Clean Design**: Organized network structure with proper brain regions

### Recommended Usage
- Use `v3/logo.svg` for all current branding (main logo)
- Maintain aspect ratio when resizing
- Ensure sufficient contrast with background
- V1 and V2 are archived for reference

### Technical Specs
- **Format**: SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
- **Compatibility**: Modern browsers, design software
- **Gradients**: Linear gradients with multiple stops
- **Effects**: SVG filters for glow effects  
- **Transparency**: Background elements only, maintains brain visibility

### File Sizes
- `v1/logo.svg`: ~15KB (detailed network)
- `v1/logo_small.svg`: ~8KB (simplified)  
- `v1/logo_icon.svg`: ~4KB (minimal)
