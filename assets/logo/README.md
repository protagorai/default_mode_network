## Design Principles

### Wave Gradient System (Current)
- **Multi-Wave Approach**: Six overlapping gradient waves flow across the brain shape
- **Color Progression**: Bright green → bluer green → blue → purplish blue → purple → deep purple
- **Positional Mapping**: Elements colored based on x-coordinate position for natural wave flow
- **Glow Effects**: Neon glow applied to all vertices and connections for synthetic aesthetic

### Visual Elements
- **Brain Anatomy**: Excellent lateral view brain silhouette with proper proportions
- **Network Vertices**: 2.5px radius nodes with gradient coloring and glow
- **Triangulated Connections**: Complex network mesh forming brain structure
- **Color Waves**: Left-to-right gradient progression with smooth transitions
- **Neon Effects**: Subtle to strong glow filters creating luminous appearance

### Symbolism
- **Flowing Intelligence**: Wave gradients represent dynamic neural processing
- **Synthetic Biology**: Neon colors indicate artificial neural networks
- **Network Complexity**: Intricate triangulation shows computational sophistication  
- **Consciousness Flow**: Color waves suggest awareness flowing through neural structures

## Usage Guidelines

### Recommended Usage
- Use `logo-gradient.svg` for all primary branding applications
- `logo-red.svg` available for monochrome/reference applications
- Maintain aspect ratio when resizing
